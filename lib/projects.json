    "description": "This project explores the use of machine learning to predict GDP growth for India. India's economy is projected to become the second largest economy in the world by 2075, according to Goldman Sachs. My model employs socioeconomic indicators such as education enrollment rates, public debt ratios, and consumption patterns to build a regression model for forecasting GDP. By identifying key features and understanding their correlations with GDP growth, this model provides insights into economic trends and policy planning."

    "description": "I started this project to help our team improve our debate performance. We have won 11 out of the last 13 tournaments attended. However, the team has been having a hard time identifying week points, due to the absence of a tool that can help us analyze our performance. This tool will help us identify trends in our performance, and help us improve our performance in future tournaments. On top of that, we are seeing an improvement in our competitor's performance. This tool can help us identify who our biggest competitors are, and how we can improve our performance to beat them."
